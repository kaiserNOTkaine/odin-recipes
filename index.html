            <p>This recipe is for a Korean dish called Soft Tofu Soup.
                It is typically served boiling hot and is a versatile dish.
            </p>

            <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>The soup is made with a base, typically an anchovy base or
                one of stir fried vegetables like garlic, onions, and gochujang.
                Water is added to the base along with varying amounts of 
                gochugaru for spice. Besides tofu, pork, beef, and chicken are also 
                utilized as an extra protein. Mushrooms, green onions, and an egg 
                cracked into the dish are the most common toppings. (Well, the toppings
                that I enjoy anyways.)
